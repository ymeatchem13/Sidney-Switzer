Hey friends! I made it to Germany alive and well. I came into this trip thinking that a 6 hour time difference would not make much of a difference... oh how I was wrong! I arrived Sunday afternoon after a missed flight (that wasn’t my fault thankfully) and some restless sleep on the plane that only made me more exhausted. Then I had another flight 2 hours later. It all worked out, but it was hard to stay awake and wait for the new flight! I was super thankful that for two out of my three flights a girl from Virginia in my YWAM program had the same flights so we got to meet and figure things out together, thank the Lord!

We began our DTS (Discipleship Training School) program on Monday so there wasn’t much time to adjust. Our schedule is insanely busy, so good, but so much to take on. After my first week, I can say this season will definitely stretch my capacity. I learned so much about the Holy Spirit and how to hear the Lord's voice. As I was praying for others it was super encouraging hearing them relate to what God had me speak over them. A girl I felt like I should pray for, had never been prophesied over, so it was cool to see how the Lord moved her.

There are currently 14 people in the DTS program including me. I really am enjoying the community and making friends from Australia, Brazil, and Germany. We are all in this together so it will be nice to have each other to lean on.

On the weekend I thought it would be relaxing but I was so wrong. We each had to sign up for cooking and prepping for 3 breakfast and 3 dinners while I am here. I wanted to get them out of the way so I signed up for 2 breakfast and 2 dinners for my first weekend. I was with 1 other girl and it was so much to handle. The instructions for what we were to do were not very clear so we definitely winged it. Our meals came out tasty so that was a win! I have the next weekend off and then my last breakfast and dinner will be the following Saturday. After that I will really be enjoying the chill time and hopefully be able to process what I learn during the week.

Overall I am loving the experience and people. I am so thankful God has changed me from the inside out and I cannot wait to go deeper with him! I am learning more about the lies I have believed and what the truth is from my Heavenly Father. It warms my heart as I learn to recognize how much he delights in me. I am still catching up on sleep but thankfully my bed is super comfy. I miss my friends and family but know I am exactly where I am meant to be. I wish you all a great week!
