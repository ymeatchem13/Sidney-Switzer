## Eight Weeks of Growth

Wow I've been here for 8 weeks now and the time is really flying by. This time has exponentially grown my hunger for knowing and seeking the Lord in all I do. Most of my life I was seeking Jesus in the low moments when he wanted a relationship with me all the time.

I'm so thankful to have amazing speakers each week who come from such different backgrounds. Hearing different worldviews and how the Lord works in other countries is fascinating. I know God has called me to missions and he sees my eagerness, but he also knew I needed a time of growth and equipping.

## Ruach, Kavod, and the Holy Spirit

One of my favorite weeks was about the Holy Spirit and learning about the Hebrew words Ruach (wind) and Kavod (glory). Both explain the Holy Spirit but it was fascinating learning the dynamics of the trinity in a way I hadn't heard before.

## Faith Requires Action

Another speaker we had named Rogerio spoke some amazing truths. He talked about Jesus in us is enough to do the big things. We often want God to do all the things we don't want to do but that isn't how he works. Faith is more than thinking, it involves action.

The Lord calls us to do uncomfortable things we don't feel ready for but we are capable because we are partnering with Him. We also have the ultimate helper, the Holy Spirit! I'm thankful for the reminder that we are a new creation in Christ and he is our strength.

## Ministry in Germany

I've also been enjoying our ministry time in Germany a lot. We have spent time doing prophetic art and handing it out when the Lord highlights someone. I think it's beautiful to be able to trust the Lord that he is planting seeds, even when there is a language barrier.

## Preparing for Ethiopia

As I get ready to head to Ethiopia soon I have such an excitement for being able to teach and pour into the people. My teaching track met weekly to understand how to lead and public speaking. This has been super helpful with understanding how to formulate a teaching/sermon. We've also been able to practice with each other and get feedback to improve.
