## Hallo! (This the normal German greeting when saying hello)

The weather here in Germany is cloudy and rainy, so I am still getting used to not seeing the sun much. This week I have learned about what healthy relationships look like and how to invite God into working through forgiving others. This has been a challenging area for most of my life. I think about all the friendships that I have had. I've been hurt by plenty of people, but I have also hurt others. There are people I need to forgive starting with myself. I started that process for some deep wounds as well as wounds I thought were healed. Healing is a process that can't be rushed. I want to forgive and forget but that is not how this works. My role is to ask God to help me heal and he will guide my steps.

This week, I'm contemplating whether the people in my life draw me nearer to God or lead me astray. It is difficult learning who truly pours into you and who doesn’t. I’m really thinking about how important the people around you are because they shape you as a person. I want to be the best version of myself so I’m having to learn who to keep close to me and who I need to distance myself from. It is a hard truth. I’m also recognizing there are people who have hurt me and I have been holding on to those feelings thinking that would ‘justify’ what happened when in reality it has only hurt me more. I’m really focusing on giving all my burdens to God because I don’t want these things to weigh me down. God is inviting me to surrender everything to him. I am learning how to do that in all aspects of my life. He wants to be a part of everything. Forgiveness is a long process and we will forever be growing, but he is helping me recognize people I still need to forgive and how to do that with him.

On a fun note I had some great food on my weekend out exploring. My first crepe in Nuremberg was so good! It was Nutella of course. My friends and I also got a Hawaiian pizza which was amazing! While the city is crazy busy, the food variety is awesome.
