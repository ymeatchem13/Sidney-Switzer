## A Month in Ethiopia Already

I can't believe I've been in Ethiopia for over a month! Our team has just spent the last week in Kara which is one of the many tribes in Ethiopia. Living in a tent in 100+ degrees wasn't on my to do list for 2025 (or ever to be honest) but God is full of surprises.

## Discipleship Training With the Kara

I really enjoyed my time helping lead a discipleship training for the young men in the Kara and neighboring tribes. Six members of our team are running this and it has been so cool to see God use each of us and our gifts.

It has been fascinating seeing how much the young men know the Bible because for some it's their only resource they have to know the Lord. How great a God we serve that he can encounter anyone and anywhere. Although it can be hard to talk to them due to language barriers, having the commonality of loving Jesus brought immediate connection.

These brothers in Christ have lived such a different life than mine, yet they carry joy like no other. Being able to teach in a setting like this felt so natural and being able to encourage each one of these believers was such an honor. Saying goodbye was especially difficult, the love I felt for each of them runs deep. We held a mini graduation for them and I did a send off prayer for each one of them. I pray the Lord brings me back someday!

## Monti's Healing & Transformation

One of the most moving experiences occurred when we encountered Monti, a woman from the Kara tribe. After traveling for hours on foot to reach our camp, she asked for prayer for a serious health issue. Monti explained she was having sharp pain in her eyes, which had resulted in blurry vision. She had undergone surgery in a nearby city, but the pain had persisted.

We gathered around her, laying hands and praying not only for healing but also for her heart to soften towards Jesus. After just 10 minutes of prayer, Monti shared that the pain was gone, and her eyesight had been restored! We then shared the Gospel with her, and she accepted Jesus into her life.

### A Changed Heart

Monti spent the next few days with us, cooking and caring for the young men of the discipleship training. Her face radiated a newfound joyâ€”an outward sign of the transformation happening within her. It was a reminder of how intentional God is in our lives, even when we don't fully understand the reasons behind our actions. Monti was seeking healing, but what she truly found was Jesus. Praise God!

## Arriving in Hamer

Next, we're spending a few days in Hamer, where the people have been incredibly kind. We arrived at 11:30 pm and they greeted our cars with song and dance. There was also a fire going for us. When we sat down they began to wash our team's feet which was so touching.

Each person here has such a heart to serve, their actions showed their delight to have us here with them even though we would only be there a few short days.

### The Camp & Accommodations

We camped right out in the open with our tents, which was an adjustment, but it was nice being able to be so close to the church and the bathroom was only a few minutes walk. Speaking of the 'bathroom', it was a deep hole surrounded by shrubs and sticks for privacy. There are no outhouses here! I'm thankful we had that because in Kara it was digging our own holes.

### Worship & Connection

The people here love to worship and definitely prefer less teachings. I know they are so thankful to be having us here and it's a blessing to be able to spend time with them. The weather here feels about 110 or hotter so I feel a lot more fatigued.

Being on the mission field isn't always glamorous but it truly is a joy to be here. We now have to have 2 separate translators to translate to Amharic and then their native tribal language. I know that translating can change what is ultimately being said, but I know God is doing something here with these wonderful people.
