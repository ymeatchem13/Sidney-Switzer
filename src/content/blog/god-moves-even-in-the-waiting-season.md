## Coming Home Changed

Adjusting back to life in Cincinnati after six months away has not been easy. I knew coming home would feel different, but I didn't fully realize just how much I had changed—or how much everything around me would feel the same. It's a strange tension to hold: returning to a familiar place as someone who no longer fits the mold of who you were when you left.

## Finding Rest in Him

These past few weeks have been filled with moments of both joy and quiet struggle. God, in His kindness, has been giving me space to rest—but not just physical rest. He's teaching me how to rest in Him.

It's one thing to take a break; it's another to be still and let your soul be restored by the One who knows you completely. I'm learning that true rest isn't found in checking out—it's found in leaning in.

## When Others Don't Understand

Not everyone fully understands this shift in me, and that's been a little hard. It definitely has been amazing to reconnect with friends and family. Some people have been excited to see me, eager to hear about my trip and all that God did. Others, not so much.

And while that used to discourage me, the Lord keeps reminding me that only His opinion truly matters. He sees the seeds that were planted, both overseas and here at home. Even if people don't ask about my experiences or engage with my stories, that doesn't mean the testimony is wasted. God is always at work—even in the unseen.

## The Next Chapter: Amsterdam

Looking ahead, I'm filled with so much excitement and anticipation. This fall, I'll be starting a 10-month Bible school in Amsterdam—a door I know God has opened. I can feel the weight and beauty of this next step, and I'm so eager to dive into what He has planned.

But at the same time, I'm learning not to rush this season I'm in. Home is not just a layover; it's an assignment too.

## More Than Waiting

This time is for more than just waiting. It's for pouring into relationships, deepening my roots, and staying open to whatever else God wants to do right here, right now. I don't want to miss what He has for me today because I'm too focused on tomorrow.

September will come, and so will Amsterdam—but this time back in Cincinnati has its own purpose. I'm choosing to trust that this season is just as important as the one to come and to be patient as the Lord is doing something.
