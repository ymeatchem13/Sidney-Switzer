## Arriving in Ethiopia

Our first few days in Ethiopia have been absolutely amazing. I feel so full of joy and thankfulness.

## A Day at ICare Ministry

Today we went to a kid's ministry called ICare. The founder was sponsored as a child there and now he is doing so much for the kingdom.

### What ICare Does

The ministry helps single mothers and their children get off the street and empowers them. They help with:

- Rent assistance
- Life skills training for women
- Daycare for children
- Food and supplies

They currently have 75 moms in the program.

### Time With the Kids

We got to visit with the kids and it was the best time! They are so sweet and loving. They have such beautiful faces and their smiles melted my heart. They hugged and held on to us which was so cute.

A few of the girls sang songs for us in Amharic, which is the main language of Ethiopia, although there are over 80 total languages in the country. It was so good to be able to play games and spread joy with them.

I know the Father's love for each one of these sweet children runs so deeply and I pray they know how he loves them.

## Lunch & Ethiopian Cuisine

Afterwards we had lunch and got to enjoy our first official Ethiopian dish known as injera with shiro and some meat which was delicious!
