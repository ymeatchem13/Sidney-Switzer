I truly am so blessed to have been in the beautiful nation of Ethiopia. Being able to travel to over 11 cities/regions and meet so many people was incredible. This has been one of the best seasons of my life and it’s difficult to say farewell. I’ve been stretched in so many ways in the best possible ways. When you give your yes to Jesus he can multiply and pour out a 100 times more! Seeing him heal and change lives all because of my yes was something I will never forget. I’m so thankful for the deep friendships he brought to me during this time, both people from my DTS team and Ethiopian friends. Living out of a backpack was so much easier than I thought too! Getting to embrace the culture of this nation was such a joy, and I can’t wait to be back one day.
